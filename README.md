# Options Diagram Project

The purpose of this project is to create payoff charts for a portfolio of options.

The payoff chart will be web-based and allow users to graph their portfolio to visualize payoffs and strategies given certain inputs.
We aim to differ from similar sites by offering different features (such as being able to open positions of the asset, offering an "Options Trading for Dummies" for new traders, and pre-built strategy diagrams).

Technologies Used:
- React
- [ApexCharts](https://apexcharts.com/)
